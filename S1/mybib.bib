  abstract  = "Widely regarded as the standard text on EMC, Tim Williams' book
               provides all the key information needed to meet the requirements
               of the latest EMC Directive. Most importantly, it shows how to
               incorporate EMC principles into the product design process,
               avoiding cost and performance penalties, meeting the needs of
               specific standards and resulting in a better overall product. As
               well as covering the very latest legal requirements, the fourth
               edition has been thoroughly updated in line with the latest best
               practice in EMC compliance and product design. Coverage has been
               considerably expanded to include the R\&TTE and Automotive EMC
               Directives, as well the military aerospace standards of DEF STAN
               59-41 and DO160E. A new chapter on systems EMC is included,
               while short case studies demonstrate how EMC product design is
               put into practice. Tim Williams has worked for a variety of
               companies as an electronic design engineer over the last 25
               years. He has monitored the progress of the EMC Directive and
               its associated standards since it was first made public. He now
               runs his own consultancy specialising in EMC design and test
               advice and training. * Includes the compliance procedures of the
               latest EMC Directive: 2004/108/EC * Short case studies
               demonstrating how EMC product design is put into practice. *
